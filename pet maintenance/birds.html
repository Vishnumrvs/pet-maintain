<h2>Eclectus Parrot</h2>
<h3>Species Overview</h3>
<p>
    COMMON NAMES: Eclectus parrot, Solomon Island eclectus parrot, Grand eclectus parrot, yellow-sided eclectus parrot, Vosmaeri eclectus parrot, blue-bellied eclectus parrot, red-sided eclectus parrot, dusky eclectus parrot<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Eclectus roratus<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 17 and 20 inches, weighing 13 to 18 ounces<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 30 to 50 years</p>
    <p>Charming, eye-catching, and intelligent, eclectus parrots are captivating birds that make impressive pets. Their beautiful colors, talking ability, and lovable personalities have established this bird as one of the most popular pet parrots. This bird is one of the larger parrot species, and it does require the right owner with plenty of time and space to house this bird.</p>
    <h3>Speech and Vocalizations</h3>
    <p>
        Eclectus parrots join Amazons and African greys as being one of the best species for training to speak. They are quick to learn almost anything you want to teach them. Many people find them to be on the quieter side when compared to other parrots. They have a distinctive honk and other vocalizations that can be amusing the first few times, but loud and startling.</p>
    <h3>Caring for an Eclectus Parrot</h3>
    <p>
        Most eclectus birds can live in a multiple bird household, but some have jealous tendencies. Make sure to give an eclectus your undivided time and attention when introducing your eclectus or any new bird or your aviary.
        An eclectus lives best in an aviary—11 feet long by 3 foot wide and 7 feet high—especially if you keep a pair. These birds like to fly, climb, and stay busy. If you do not have room for an aviary, then make sure the cage you provide is at the minimum 2 feet long by 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    In the wild, these birds prefer pomegranate, papaya, and figs, though they'll also eat flowers, buds on trees, and a few seeds. When kept as a pet, their diet must include fresh fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates. Cooked pasta or grain bake—a homemade casserole just for birds—will ensure they get all the necessary carbs.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    The eclectus are active birds and need plenty of room to exercise. They should have access to a large play stand and a bird-safe area for climbing and exploring. At the very least, provide an hour of free flight time before breakfast and another hour of free flight time before dinner.
    You'll also want to provide these birds many perches of different materials and diameters, so their feet remain healthy.</p>

    <h2 id="align">Cockatiel</h2>
    <h3>Species Overview</h3>
    <p>
        COMMON NAMES: Cockatiel, tiel, quarrion (quarrian), weiro (weero)<br>        
        SCIENTIFIC NAME: Nymphicus hollandicus<br>        
        ADULT SIZE: 12 or 13 inches, weighing between 2 to 4 ounces<br>        
        LIFE EXPECTANCY: 15 to 20 years with proper care, and sometimes as long as 30 years, though this is rare</p>
        
        <p>The cockatiel is a small parrot who sports a variety of colorful patterns and a head crest. Also known as quarrions or weiros, these birds aren't as loud as other parrots, though they can still mimic speech and whistle.
            Because of cockatiels' smaller size, it's easier to care and tame them compared to other parrot species. In fact, they're friendly birds who enjoy pets and playing with their owners. As long as they have plenty of time to exercise and play, they're a low-maintenance pet.</p>
        <h3>Speech and Vocalizations</h3>
        <p>
            Cockatiels vocalize and whistle but are not as loud as some other parrots. By reputation, males have the upper hand for mimicking speech and whistles. But female cockatiels are no slouch; they are good at mimicry, too. Either sex may repeat sounds from your house, including alarm clocks, phones, and even wild birds outside.</p>
<h3>Caring for the Cockatiel</h3>
<p>
    A pair of birds will make good company for each other, but that means they may not bond as well with you or mimic speech and sounds. Keeping a single bird is fine, but you need to spend a significant amount of time interacting with your cockatiel daily. If your lifestyle makes this impossible, get a pair of birds to prevent loneliness.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Variety is the key to a healthy diet for any parrot, including cockatiels. Seeds can be a nutritious part of the diet, but they are high in fat. Seeds should be no more than 30 percent of the bird's diet. Pelleted diets are often the right choice for birds as they are nutritionally balanced and birds can't pick out their favorite seeds and leave the rest.
    To make sure that your bird gets all the nutrients it needs, offer a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. In general, a cockatiel eats about 1 tablespoon of food per day. This is why what goes into that tablespoon matters.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>As with any parrot, activities will make a cockatiel happy and help maintain their physical and mental health. If your bird spends most of the time in a cage, be sure the enclosure is large enough for the bird to fly. Provide plenty of toys that can stimulate the bird's natural inclination to play. Perches, ladders, and toys should be plentiful but not to the point that it hinders the bird's movement around the cage.</p>
