    <h2 id="align">Golden Retriever</h2>
    <h3>Breed Overview</h3>
    <p>
        GROUP: Sporting<br>
        HEIGHT: 23 to 24 inches (males); 21.5 to 22.5 inches (females)<br>        
        WEIGHT: 65 to 75 pounds (males); 55 to 65 pounds (females)<br>        
        COAT: Medium-length double coat<br>        
        COAT COLOR: Light to dark gold<br>        
        LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years<br>        
        TEMPERAMENT: Trustworthy, intelligent, playful, energetic.<br>        
        HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>        
        ORIGIN: United Kingdom, Scotland
        </p>
        <p>The golden retriever is a medium-sized breed boasting a golden coat—reflective of its name— originating from Scotland. Known for their kind eyes, loyalty, and enthusiasm for life, the golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. Though historically bred as hunting dogs in the Scottish Highlands, goldens also make excellent family dogs.</p>
        <h3>Golden Retriever Care</h3>
        <p>
            Golden retrievers have medium-length hair with a thick undercoat and a water-repellent outer coat. They shed moderately most of the year and heavily in the spring and fall. They should be brushed daily and will probably need a bath about once a month. You can expect to live with plenty of dog hair if you have a golden retriever.</p>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Goldens are active dogs which require daily exercise and thorough training. It is best for a golden retriever to have access to a play yard for romping and to be taken out for a walk a couple of times per day. Golden retrievers get along well with most other dogs and a trip to the free-run dog park is likely to be appreciated.
    Golden retrievers are known to be mouthy, carrying things around in their mouths. Have toys and chew bones available to satisfy this oral fixation.
</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
    <p>
    This breed likes to be where the action is with the family rather than relegated to the yard, where they can easily get lonely. They are not suited to be watchdogs, as they are friendly with everyone. Socialization is important for dogs and comes pretty naturally to the golden retriever. They should do well in a multi-pet household with other canines and cats.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Golden retriever puppies grow rapidly and should be on a low-calorie puppy diet that will keep them from growing too fast and increasing their risk of bone disorders. An adult golden retriever should be fed two meals a day of up to 1.5 cups of dry dog food per meal. It's best to measure out the food and provide it as meals rather than leaving food out for free-feeding. The amount needed for an individual dog depends on its size, activity level, age, and other factors. You should always provide fresh, clean water.</p>

    <img src="img/German Shepherd.jpg" alt="Dog"></div>
<h2 id="align">German Shepherd</h2>
<h3>Breed Overview</h3>
    GROUP: Herding<br>    
    HEIGHT: 22 to 26 inches  <br>   
    WEIGHT: 60 to 100 pounds<br>     
    COAT: Coarse, medium-length double coat<br>     
    COAT COLOR: Black and tan, black and cream, black and red, black and silver, solid black, gray, sable. Note that blue, liver or white are unfavorable based on breed standards.<br> 
    TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, courageous, alert, bold, loyal, protective<br> 
    HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>     
    ORIGIN: Germany<br><br>

    German shepherd dogs are one of the most popular breeds in the world, treasured for their intelligence, loyalty, and athleticism. They're large brown-and-black dogs with a streamlined build that makes them both strong and agile.
    Though they're excellent herding dogs, German shepherds are also very well suited to work as service animals, such as guide dogs for the visually impaired. They also serve as police officers, members of the military, guard dogs, and even movie stars.
</p><br>
<h3>German Shepherd Care</h3>
<p>
    German shepherd dogs require frequent care, training, and attention but they will reward you with many years of loyalty and love. They are well suited to families, though they're best acquired as pets when they're young so they have ample time to adjust to life with their humans and undergo training.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Plenty of regular exercise is essential for German shepherds because they have so much energy. A daily walk is not enough. If you're a jogger, a German shepherd can be a good running companion. Your dog needs to run, play, and explore to prevent frustration, boredom, and pent-up energy. A bored dog may resort to barking, digging, and chewing.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>
    German shepherds can be very gentle companions and family protectors with proper training and socialization. They're an ideal breed for active households, and the intelligence and protective demeanor of this breed can make it a good choice for families with children as long as the dog is properly trained.</p>       
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Your adult German shepherd will need two meals a day of up to 2 cups of dry dog food, but this will depend on the dog's size, activity level, age, and health. You may also want to mix canned dog food into the kibble for extra flavor and interest. German shepherds are prone to bloating and possible stomach torsion, so you'll want to avoid giving one large meal a day and having the dog gulp it down. Be sure your dog has constant access to clean, fresh water.</p>
<h3>German Shepherd Overview</h3>
<p>
    
German shepherds are perennially popular dogs and will continue to be desirable, loving companions for decades to come. Provided you can meet their requirements for training, exercise and companionship, they are sure to be a great addition to your home and family.

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>Loyal, loving</ul>
<ul>Smart, trainable</ul>
<ul>Effective guard dog</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>Needs a yard and plenty of exercise</ul>
<ul>Can be aggressive without training</ul>
<ul>May not get along with other pets</ul>

    <img src="img/Siberian Husky.jpg" alt="Dog"></div>
<h2 id="align">Siberian Husky</h2>
<h3>Breed Overview</h3>
<p>
    GROUP: Working<br>    
    HEIGHT: 20 to 23.5 inches<br>    
    WEIGHT: 35 to 60 pounds<br>    
    COAT: A dense, double coat<br>    
    COAT COLOR: Seen in a variety of colors, including combinations of black, gray, white, and tan. They have markings that include black points, piebald, or pinto.<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 12 to 15 years<br>
    TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, alert, friendly, protective, gentle<br>    
    HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>    
    ORIGIN: Siberia</p>
    <p>The Siberian husky is a graceful, athletic dog with high endurance and an eagerness to work. This friendly dog breed, which originated in Northeast Asia as a sled dog, has a vivacious and mischievous personality. Though these are high-energy and sometimes intense dogs, huskies can be affectionate and gentle when given proper care. They were brought to America through Alaska.</p>
<h3>Siberian Husky Care</h3>
<p>
    Siberian huskies were bred as pack teams and they generally get along well with other dogs. That can make them suitable for trips to a securely-fenced free-run dog park. They have a strong prey drive and that can prove to be a problem if you have pet rodents, rabbits, or even cats. However, if raised together with a cat, they may coexist well.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Huskies can benefit from activities like running as long as it's not too warm outside. You may need to find creative ways to exercise your husky indoors when it's hot outside, as this breed is only moderately heat-tolerant. Huskies like to dig and you can expect plenty of holes in your yard. A bored husky indoors or outdoors can be very destructive.</p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>
        Huskies are energetic and smart dogs that can be vocal (often in the form of howling or whining). They require a lot of training and exercise to keep them happy and healthy. Many Huskies have a desire to explore and can be escape artists, so they can't be walked off-leash as they will be off exploring and chasing small animals.</p>
        <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies were bred to require less food than some similarly sized breeds. Provide your dog with two meals per day, each of which should be up to a cup of dry dog food. Your dog's specific dietary needs will depend on size, activity level, age, and other factors. Be sure to monitor your dog's weight to prevent obesity and discuss your dog's nutritional needs with your veterinarian.</p>
            <h3>Siberian Husky Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Pros</h4>
                <ul>Friendly and gentle with all ages and most animals</ul>                
                <ul>A low predisposition to hereditary diseases</ul>                
                <ul>Intelligent and easy to train</ul>
                <h4>Cons</h4>
                <ul>Heavy shedding, particularly during a twice-a-year shed</ul>
                <ul>Prone to vocalization, including particularly loud howling</ul>                
                <ul>Requires a significant amount of exercise</ul>

    <h2 id="align">Highlander</h2>
    <h3>Breed Overview</h3>
    <p>
        OTHER NAMES: None<br>        
        PERSONALITY: Playful, energetic, clownish<br>        
        WEIGHT: 10 to 20 pounds, with males slightly larger<br>        
        LENGTH: 15 to 22 inches <br>
        COAT LENGTH: Up to 2.5 inches <br>        
        COAT COLOR: All colors permissible; patterns include solid, tortie, tabby, silver/smoke<br>        
        EYE COLOR: Varies<br>
        LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 to 15 years<br>        
        HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>        
        ORIGIN: United States
    </p>
    <p>Developed to resemble big cats, the highlander is a medium to large, muscular, and athletic cat with a naturally short tail. The highlander comes in both shorthaired and longhaired versions, and they may come in any color in solid, tortie, tabby, or silver/smoke patterns.</p>
    <h3>Highlander Cat Care </h3>
    <p>
        Highlanders come with both short and long coats, so grooming varies depending on coat length. Brush both coat types several times a week with a soft slicker brush to remove loose hair and cut down on shedding on your furniture and clothing. For the longhaired highlander, pay careful attention to the shaggy belly hair, which is longer than the rest of the coat. Brush or comb this belly fur thoroughly to prevent matting. Bathe your highlander with a moisturizing shampoo every few months to keep the coat clean, soft, and shiny.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Because the highlander cat is naturally active and athletically built, he’s less inclined to become overweight. But any cat has the potential to overindulge if nutrition is not managed properly. A lean cat is a healthier cat, and staying slim can help prevent the development of obesity-related health issues like diabetes and arthritis. Don’t keep the food bowl filled all day. Instead, feed adult highlanders two meals a day. Young kittens should eat three to four times a day.</p>

    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>Unique and striking looks</ul>

<h3>Burmese Care</h3>
<p>Burmese cats' coats are short and fine with a glossy, silky shine. They require minimal grooming and do not shed much. Grooming your cat with a rubber brush once a week should be enough to rid the coat of dead hairs and keep it looking lustrous</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    To keep up with their active lifestyle, these cats need plenty of protein and nutrients. It is always best to discuss diet options with your vet to ensure all of your cat's needs are being met. High-quality dry food helps maintain good oral health and can be supplemented with wet food for added hydration.</p>

        <p>The Korat, also known as the Si-Sawat, is a stunning cat breed that originated in Thailand over 900 years ago. Known by its distinctive silver-tipped blue-gray coat and heart-shaped face, this cat has won countless admirers for its looks as well as its unique personality. It's considered a symbol of good luck in its native Thailand.
        The Korat (pronounced as koh-raht, not core-rat) is a small-to-medium feline with a sturdy, strong build and lively, alert expression.</p>
        <h3>Korat Cat Care</h3>
        <p>
            The Korat cat is extremely intelligent, playful, and affectionate. These smart felines can form a close bond with their people and love to be an involved part of your daily activities. Because of this, they do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. They are social cats and love to be with their special person. These cats should have a companion to keep them company, whether that is you or another animal. Being left alone can lead to separation anxiety and an unhappy Korat.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Providing your Korat with high-quality food will help ensure a long and healthy life. Every cat will have its own likes, dislikes, and dietary needs, but a good cat food formulated specifically for the dietary needs of felines should provide all the nutrients your pet needs to thrive. Consult your veterinarian for more information on the diet that best suits your feline.</p>

<h2 id="align">Ocellaris Clownfish</h2>
<h3>Species Overview</h3>
<p>
    COMMON NAMES: Clownfish, Ocellaris Clownfish, Common Clownfish, False Percula Clownfish, Clown Anemonefish<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Amphiprion ocellaris<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 3 inches<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 to 15 years<br>    
    </p>
    <p>Made famous by the movie Finding Nemo, the ocellaris clownfish is a very popular saltwater aquarium fish. They are good for beginners, being hardy fish and a good fit for smaller aquariums, while providing a vivid orange splash of color. They are "reef-safe," leaving corals alone. Through captive breeding programs, many color variations of these fish are readily available. Although not necessary to their survival, the clownfish always appreciates a nice anemone to call home.</p>
    <h3>Clownfish Diet and Feeding</h3>
    <p>
        Clownfish are omnivorous fish, meaning they eat a mix of meat and veggies. Like most aquarium fish, you will see them nibbling at their substrate and anemone home throughout the day. Being warm water fishes, their metabolism is constantly churning, so feeding smaller meals throughout the day is best for their digestion. Clownfish can be intimidated by larger, more aggressive fish, especially during feeding time, so try to scatter the food throughout the aquarium so everyone gets a fair share. However, don't leave uneaten food in the aquarium for long.</p>

    <img src="img/Betta (Siamese Fishing Fish).jpg" alt="Dog"></div>
<h2 id="align">Betta (Siamese Fishing Fish)</h2>
<h3>Species Overview</h3>
<p>
    COMMON NAMES: Betta, siamese fighting fish<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Betta splendens<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 3 inches (7 cm)<br>
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 2 to 3 years
    </p>
<p>Betta fish, commonly referred to as Siamese fighting fish, are one of the most popular fish breeds. With its jewel-toned coloring and flowing fins, betta fish are a great addition to any fish-lover's home. Not all betta fish fight—only the males. Female bettas can be kept together. Despite how they are often sold, bettas should not be kept in a fish bowl. Bettas are happiest when kept in water that is soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH. With the right care, bettas can live around 2 to 3 years. </p>
<h3>Betta Habitat and Care</h3>
<p>
    Bettas are one of the most recognized, most colorful, and often most controversial fish in the freshwater aquarium hobby. Debates rage about the appropriateness of keeping them in small bowls. To fully understand their needs it is important to become familiar with their native habitat, where they live in large rice paddies, shallow ponds, and even in very slow-moving streams. Although many fish keepers are aware that bettas come from shallow waters, the water temperature is often overlooked.</p>
<h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
<p>
    Betta fish should be fed two to four pellets twice a day. In nature, bettas subsist almost exclusively on insects and insect larvae. They are built with an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching any hapless insect that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the betta, however, they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen or freeze-dried foods, such as:
    
    <ul>Brine shrimp</ul>
    <ul>Daphnia</ul>
    <ul>Plankton</ul>
    <ul>Tubifex</ul>
    <ul>Glassworms</ul>
    <ul>Beef heart</ul>

<h1>Birds</h1>
<div class="pet-card">
    <img src="img/Eclectus Parrot1.jpg" alt="Dog"></div>
<h2 id="align">Eclectus Parrot</h2>
<h3>Species Overview</h3>
<p>
    COMMON NAMES: Eclectus parrot, Solomon Island eclectus parrot, Grand eclectus parrot, yellow-sided eclectus parrot, Vosmaeri eclectus parrot, blue-bellied eclectus parrot, red-sided eclectus parrot, dusky eclectus parrot<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Eclectus roratus<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 17 and 20 inches, weighing 13 to 18 ounces<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 30 to 50 years</p>
    <p>Charming, eye-catching, and intelligent, eclectus parrots are captivating birds that make impressive pets. Their beautiful colors, talking ability, and lovable personalities have established this bird as one of the most popular pet parrots. This bird is one of the larger parrot species, and it does require the right owner with plenty of time and space to house this bird.</p>
    <h3>Speech and Vocalizations</h3>
    <p>
        Eclectus parrots join Amazons and African greys as being one of the best species for training to speak. They are quick to learn almost anything you want to teach them. Many people find them to be on the quieter side when compared to other parrots. They have a distinctive honk and other vocalizations that can be amusing the first few times, but loud and startling.</p>
    <h3>Caring for an Eclectus Parrot</h3>
    <p>
        Most eclectus birds can live in a multiple bird household, but some have jealous tendencies. Make sure to give an eclectus your undivided time and attention when introducing your eclectus or any new bird or your aviary.
        An eclectus lives best in an aviary—11 feet long by 3 foot wide and 7 feet high—especially if you keep a pair. These birds like to fly, climb, and stay busy. If you do not have room for an aviary, then make sure the cage you provide is at the minimum 2 feet long by 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    In the wild, these birds prefer pomegranate, papaya, and figs, though they'll also eat flowers, buds on trees, and a few seeds. When kept as a pet, their diet must include fresh fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates. Cooked pasta or grain bake—a homemade casserole just for birds—will ensure they get all the necessary carbs.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    The eclectus are active birds and need plenty of room to exercise. They should have access to a large play stand and a bird-safe area for climbing and exploring. At the very least, provide an hour of free flight time before breakfast and another hour of free flight time before dinner.
    You'll also want to provide these birds many perches of different materials and diameters, so their feet remain healthy.</p>
    <h3>Eclectus Parrot overview</h3>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>Social, affectionate, and loves attention</ul>
    <ul>Intelligent and a great talking parrot</ul>
    <ul>Quieter parrot than the other talking species</ul>

    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>Needs an aviary or large cage to thrive</ul>

    <h2 id="align">Cockatiel</h2>
    <h3>Species Overview</h3>
    <p>
        COMMON NAMES: Cockatiel, tiel, quarrion (quarrian), weiro (weero)<br>        
        SCIENTIFIC NAME: Nymphicus hollandicus<br>        
        ADULT SIZE: 12 or 13 inches, weighing between 2 to 4 ounces<br>        
        LIFE EXPECTANCY: 15 to 20 years with proper care, and sometimes as long as 30 years, though this is rare</p>
        
        <p>The cockatiel is a small parrot who sports a variety of colorful patterns and a head crest. Also known as quarrions or weiros, these birds aren't as loud as other parrots, though they can still mimic speech and whistle.
            Because of cockatiels' smaller size, it's easier to care and tame them compared to other parrot species. In fact, they're friendly birds who enjoy pets and playing with their owners. As long as they have plenty of time to exercise and play, they're a low-maintenance pet.</p>
        <h3>Speech and Vocalizations</h3>
        <p>
            Cockatiels vocalize and whistle but are not as loud as some other parrots. By reputation, males have the upper hand for mimicking speech and whistles. But female cockatiels are no slouch; they are good at mimicry, too. Either sex may repeat sounds from your house, including alarm clocks, phones, and even wild birds outside.</p>
<h3>Caring for the Cockatiel</h3>
<p>
    A pair of birds will make good company for each other, but that means they may not bond as well with you or mimic speech and sounds. Keeping a single bird is fine, but you need to spend a significant amount of time interacting with your cockatiel daily. If your lifestyle makes this impossible, get a pair of birds to prevent loneliness.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Variety is the key to a healthy diet for any parrot, including cockatiels. Seeds can be a nutritious part of the diet, but they are high in fat. Seeds should be no more than 30 percent of the bird's diet. Pelleted diets are often the right choice for birds as they are nutritionally balanced and birds can't pick out their favorite seeds and leave the rest.
    To make sure that your bird gets all the nutrients it needs, offer a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. In general, a cockatiel eats about 1 tablespoon of food per day. This is why what goes into that tablespoon matters.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    As with any parrot, activities will make a cockatiel happy and help maintain their physical and mental health. If your bird spends most of the time in a cage, be sure the enclosure is large enough for the bird to fly. Provide plenty of toys that can stimulate the bird's natural inclination to play. Perches, ladders, and toys should be plentiful but not to the point that it hinders the bird's movement around the cage.</p>
