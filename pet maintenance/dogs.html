    <h2 id="align">Golden Retriever</h2>
    <h3>Breed Overview</h3>
    <p>

        COAT COLOR: Light to dark gold<br>

        TEMPERAMENT: Trustworthy, intelligent, playful, energetic.<br>        
        HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>        
        ORIGIN: United Kingdom, Scotland
        </p>
        <p>The golden retriever is a medium-sized breed boasting a golden coat—reflective of its name— originating from Scotland. Known for their kind eyes, loyalty, and enthusiasm for life, the golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. Though historically bred as hunting dogs in the Scottish Highlands, goldens also make excellent family dogs.</p>
        <h3>Golden Retriever Care</h3>
        <p>
            Golden retrievers have medium-length hair with a thick undercoat and a water-repellent outer coat. They shed moderately most of the year and heavily in the spring and fall. They should be brushed daily and will probably need a bath about once a month. You can expect to live with plenty of dog hair if you have a golden retriever.</p>
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Goldens are active dogs which require daily exercise and thorough training. It is best for a golden retriever to have access to a play yard for romping and to be taken out for a walk a couple of times per day. Golden retrievers get along well with most other dogs and a trip to the free-run dog park is likely to be appreciated.
    Golden retrievers are known to be mouthy, carrying things around in their mouths. Have toys and chew bones available to satisfy this oral fixation.
</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
    <p>
    This breed likes to be where the action is with the family rather than relegated to the yard, where they can easily get lonely. They are not suited to be watchdogs, as they are friendly with everyone. Socialization is important for dogs and comes pretty naturally to the golden retriever. They should do well in a multi-pet household with other canines and cats.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Golden retriever puppies grow rapidly and should be on a low-calorie puppy diet that will keep them from growing too fast and increasing their risk of bone disorders. An adult golden retriever should be fed two meals a day of up to 1.5 cups of dry dog food per meal. It's best to measure out the food and provide it as meals rather than leaving food out for free-feeding. The amount needed for an individual dog depends on its size, activity level, age, and other factors. You should always provide fresh, clean water.</p>

<h2 id="align">German Shepherd</h2>
<h3>Breed Overview</h3>
    GROUP: Herding<br>    
    HEIGHT: 22 to 26 inches  <br>   
    WEIGHT: 60 to 100 pounds<br>     
    COAT: Coarse, medium-length double coat<br>     
    COAT COLOR: Black and tan, black and cream, black and red, black and silver, solid black, gray, sable. Note that blue, liver or white are unfavorable based on breed standards.<br> 
    TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, courageous, alert, bold, loyal, protective<br> 
    HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>     
    ORIGIN: Germany<br><br>

    German shepherd dogs are one of the most popular breeds in the world, treasured for their intelligence, loyalty, and athleticism. They're large brown-and-black dogs with a streamlined build that makes them both strong and agile.
    Though they're excellent herding dogs, German shepherds are also very well suited to work as service animals, such as guide dogs for the visually impaired. They also serve as police officers, members of the military, guard dogs, and even movie stars.
</p><br>
<h3>German Shepherd Care</h3>
<p>
    German shepherd dogs require frequent care, training, and attention but they will reward you with many years of loyalty and love. They are well suited to families, though they're best acquired as pets when they're young so they have ample time to adjust to life with their humans and undergo training.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Plenty of regular exercise is essential for German shepherds because they have so much energy. A daily walk is not enough. If you're a jogger, a German shepherd can be a good running companion. Your dog needs to run, play, and explore to prevent frustration, boredom, and pent-up energy. A bored dog may resort to barking, digging, and chewing.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>
    German shepherds can be very gentle companions and family protectors with proper training and socialization. They're an ideal breed for active households, and the intelligence and protective demeanor of this breed can make it a good choice for families with children as long as the dog is properly trained.</p>       
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Your adult German shepherd will need two meals a day of up to 2 cups of dry dog food, but this will depend on the dog's size, activity level, age, and health. You may also want to mix canned dog food into the kibble for extra flavor and interest. German shepherds are prone to bloating and possible stomach torsion, so you'll want to avoid giving one large meal a day and having the dog gulp it down. Be sure your dog has constant access to clean, fresh water.</p>
<h3>German Shepherd Overview</h3>
<p>
    
German shepherds are perennially popular dogs and will continue to be desirable, loving companions for decades to come. Provided you can meet their requirements for training, exercise and companionship, they are sure to be a great addition to your home and family.

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>Loyal, loving</ul>

<ul>Effective guard dog</ul>

<h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
<h3>Breed Overview</h3>
<p>
    GROUP: Working<br>    
    HEIGHT: 20 to 23.5 inches<br>    
    WEIGHT: 35 to 60 pounds<br>    
    COAT: A dense, double coat<br>    
    COAT COLOR: Seen in a variety of colors, including combinations of black, gray, white, and tan. They have markings that include black points, piebald, or pinto.<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 12 to 15 years<br>
    TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, alert, friendly, protective, gentle<br>    
    HYPOALLERGENIC: No<br>    
    ORIGIN: Siberia</p>
    <p>The Siberian husky is a graceful, athletic dog with high endurance and an eagerness to work. This friendly dog breed, which originated in Northeast Asia as a sled dog, has a vivacious and mischievous personality. Though these are high-energy and sometimes intense dogs, huskies can be affectionate and gentle when given proper care. They were brought to America through Alaska.</p>
<h3>Siberian Husky Care</h3>
<p>
    Siberian huskies were bred as pack teams and they generally get along well with other dogs. That can make them suitable for trips to a securely-fenced free-run dog park. They have a strong prey drive and that can prove to be a problem if you have pet rodents, rabbits, or even cats. However, if raised together with a cat, they may coexist well.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
    Huskies can benefit from activities like running as long as it's not too warm outside. You may need to find creative ways to exercise your husky indoors when it's hot outside, as this breed is only moderately heat-tolerant. Huskies like to dig and you can expect plenty of holes in your yard. A bored husky indoors or outdoors can be very destructive.</p>
    <h3>Training</h3>
    <p>
        Huskies are energetic and smart dogs that can be vocal (often in the form of howling or whining). They require a lot of training and exercise to keep them happy and healthy. Many Huskies have a desire to explore and can be escape artists, so they can't be walked off-leash as they will be off exploring and chasing small animals.</p>
        <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
            Siberian Huskies were bred to require less food than some similarly sized breeds. Provide your dog with two meals per day, each of which should be up to a cup of dry dog food. Your dog's specific dietary needs will depend on size, activity level, age, and other factors. Be sure to monitor your dog's weight to prevent obesity and discuss your dog's nutritional needs with your veterinarian.</p>
