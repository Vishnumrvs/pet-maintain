                well-being.</p>

<h3>Siberian Husky Care</h3>
            <p>Siberian Huskies, bred as pack teams, get along well with other dogs. Suitable for securely-fenced
                free-run dog parks, they have a strong prey drive, which may pose challenges with smaller pets. With
                proper introduction, they can coexist well with cats.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>Huskies benefit from activities like running, but caution is needed in warm weather. Creative indoor
                exercises are essential during hot days. Huskies have a penchant for digging, so expect some yard holes.
                Ensuring mental and physical stimulation is crucial to prevent destructive behavior.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
            <p>Energetic and smart, Huskies can be vocal and require consistent training and exercise. Their explorer
                nature may make off-leash walks challenging. Attention to their howling tendencies is needed to avoid
                disturbances.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Siberian Huskies were bred to require less food than some similar-sized breeds. Provide two meals per
                day, up to a cup of dry dog food each. Tailor the diet based on size, activity level, and age. Regular
                weight monitoring is essential, and consult with your veterinarian regarding specific nutritional needs.
