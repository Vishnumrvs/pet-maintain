      <h2>Provide a Balanced Diet:</h2>
      <p>First of all in this list, Dog foods are designed to meet a dog’s nutritional needs and cat foods are designed to meet a cat’s nutritional needs.
        Feed your pet high-quality, nutritionally balanced food suitable for their species, age, and health condition.
        Table scraps are typically not good for dogs and cats because many of the foods we eat, such as salt, garlic, and onions are bad for your pet’s health and can make them sick or even be fatal.
        Consult with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate portion sizes and dietary requirements.</p>

      <h2> Toys and Playtime:</h2>
      For a pet lover, toys aren't just accessories, they're the keys to unlocking joy and well-being in their furry friend's life.
    These playful tools serve as avenues for shared adventures, fostering physical health through games of fetch or tug-of-war for dogs,
    and engaging cats in delightful, instinctual activities with feather wands or interactive toys. Beyond the physical, toys are mental gymnastics,
    challenging their intelligence and staving off boredom. But it goes deeper, toys are ambassadors of love, comfort, and bonding. 
    Soft plushies become trusted companions, and interactive play becomes a language that transcends words, strengthening the unique connection between pets and their human companions.
    There's a reassurance in the familiar scent of a well-loved toy, offering emotional comfort and companionship, especially during times when a pet may find themselves alone.

<section id="exercise">
  <h2>regular exercise. </h2>
          <p>Proper pet care also includes exercising your pet. Exercise is an important part of your pet’s mental, as well as physical, health. 
          If you spend any time on social media, you know that all kinds of animals like to play such as this ball-playing turtle, this dog playing fetch by himself or 
          this bird playing with a red cup. What some people consider misbehavior in a pet is just the pet getting bored an amusing itself by getting in the garbage or 
          tearing up the couch or…well you get the idea. Need some suggestions on what to do with your dog? Check out The Animal Foundation’s Guide to Your Dog’s Play 
          Time and Activities.
          
          Pets also benefit from socialization, whether that’s regular interaction with you, having guests come over, or trips outside of the house. 
          Expand their horizons and improve their people skills while helping them to safely experience new things!</p>

      <h2>Collar Tag and Leashes:</h2>
      These little Collar tags are like your pet's personal ID card. Engraving their name and your contact details ensures a quick reunion if they ever get lost.
        It's a small investment that can make a big difference in keeping your pet safe and secure.
        A good leash is more than a walking accessory, it's a tool for bonding and control during outings. It ensures your pet stays close and
        protected while allowing for enjoyable walks. Whether you're exploring the neighborhood or navigating a busy park,
        a leash is a fundamental safety measure.

<section id="healthy-habits">
  <h2>Pets require doctor visits and healthy habits.</h2>
  <p>To ensure that your pets are healthy and nimble, you should take them to a local, trusted veterinarian for wellness check-ups at least once a year. 
      Keeping up on your pet’s vaccinations is essential. Clean teeth and healthy gums also play an important role in your pet’s health.  
      If your furry friend is showing signs or symptoms of being sick, take them to your vet or animal hospital right away to get them feeling better sooner rather than later!
      Another way to keep your pets healthy and happy is to regularly groom them (if needed). Matted fur can be painful and unhealthy for dogs. Dogs and cats may 
      not like it, but baths, brushings, nail trims, and flea/tick removal may be necessary for your pet’s well-being.
      With the above tips on proper pet care, you and your beloved pet are well on your way to a lifetime of happiness together!</p>
