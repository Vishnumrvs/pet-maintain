            <h3>Species Overview</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>COMMON NAMES:</strong> Cockatiel, tiel, quarrion (quarrian), weiro (weero)<br>
                <strong>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Nymphicus hollandicus<br>
                <strong>ADULT SIZE:</strong> 12 or 13 inches, weighing between 2 to 4 ounces<br>
                <strong>LIFE EXPECTANCY:</strong> 15 to 20 years with proper care, and sometimes as long as 30 years,
                though this is rare
            </p>

            <p>The cockatiel is a small parrot who sports a variety of colorful patterns and a head crest. Also known as
                quarrions or weiros, these birds aren't as loud as other parrots, though they can still mimic speech and
                whistle. Because of cockatiels' smaller size, it's easier to care and tame them compared to other parrot
                species. In fact, they're friendly birds who enjoy pets and playing with their owners. As long as they
                have plenty of time to exercise and play, they're a low-maintenance pet.</p>

            <h3>Speech and Vocalizations</h3>
            <p>
                Cockatiels vocalize and whistle but are not as loud as some other parrots. By reputation, males have the
                upper hand for mimicking speech and whistles. But female cockatiels are no slouch; they are good at
                mimicry, too. Either sex may repeat sounds from your house, including alarm clocks, phones, and even
                wild birds outside.
            </p>

            <h3>Caring for the Cockatiel</h3>
            <p>
                A pair of birds will make good company for each other, but that means they may not bond as well with you
                or mimic speech and sounds. Keeping a single bird is fine, but you need to spend a significant amount of
                time interacting with your cockatiel daily. If your lifestyle makes this impossible, get a pair of birds
                to prevent loneliness.
            </p>

            <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Variety is the key to a healthy diet for any parrot, including cockatiels. Seeds can be a nutritious
                part of the diet, but they are high in fat. Seeds should be no more than 30 percent of the bird's diet.
                Pelleted diets are often the right choice for birds as they are nutritionally balanced and birds can't
                pick out their favorite seeds and leave the rest. To make sure that your bird gets all the nutrients it
                needs, offer a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. In general, a cockatiel eats about 1 tablespoon of
                food per day. This is why what goes into that tablespoon matters.
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                As with any parrot, activities will make a cockatiel happy and help maintain their physical and mental
                health. If your bird spends most of the time in a cage, be sure the enclosure is large enough for the
                bird to fly. Provide plenty of toys that can stimulate the bird's natural inclination to play. Perches,
                ladders, and toys should be plentiful but not to the point that it hinders the bird's movement around
                the cage.
            </p>
