    <h3>Species Overview</h3>
    <p>
    COMMON NAMES: Clownfish, Ocellaris Clownfish, Common Clownfish, False Percula Clownfish, Clown Anemonefish<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Amphiprion ocellaris<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 3 inches<br>    
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 to 15 years<br>    
    </p>
    <p>Made famous by the movie Finding Nemo, the ocellaris clownfish is a very popular saltwater aquarium fish. They are good for beginners, being hardy fish and a good fit for smaller aquariums, while providing a vivid orange splash of color. They are "reef-safe," leaving corals alone. Through captive breeding programs, many color variations of these fish are readily available. Although not necessary to their survival, the clownfish always appreciates a nice anemone to call home.</p>
    <h3>Clownfish Diet and Feeding</h3>
    <p>
        Clownfish are omnivorous fish, meaning they eat a mix of meat and veggies. Like most aquarium fish, you will see them nibbling at their substrate and anemone home throughout the day. Being warm water fishes, their metabolism is constantly churning, so feeding smaller meals throughout the day is best for their digestion. Clownfish can be intimidated by larger, more aggressive fish, especially during feeding time, so try to scatter the food throughout the aquarium so everyone gets a fair share. However, don't leave uneaten food in the aquarium for long.</p>

    <h2 id="align">Betta (Siamese Fishing Fish)</h2>
    <h3>Species Overview</h3>
    <p>
    COMMON NAMES: Betta, siamese fighting fish<br>    
    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Betta splendens<br>    
    ADULT SIZE: 3 inches (7 cm)<br>
    LIFE EXPECTANCY: 2 to 3 years
    </p>
    <p>Betta fish, commonly referred to as Siamese fighting fish, are one of the most popular fish breeds. With its jewel-toned coloring and flowing fins, betta fish are a great addition to any fish-lover's home. Not all betta fish fightâ€”only the males. Female bettas can be kept together. Despite how they are often sold, bettas should not be kept in a fish bowl. Bettas are happiest when kept in water that is soft, warm, with a neutral to slightly acidic pH. With the right care, bettas can live around 2 to 3 years. </p>
    <h3>Betta Habitat and Care</h3>
    <p>
    Bettas are one of the most recognized, most colorful, and often most controversial fish in the freshwater aquarium hobby. Debates rage about the appropriateness of keeping them in small bowls. To fully understand their needs it is important to become familiar with their native habitat, where they live in large rice paddies, shallow ponds, and even in very slow-moving streams. Although many fish keepers are aware that bettas come from shallow waters, the water temperature is often overlooked.</p>
    <h3>Diet and Feeding</h3>
    <p>
    Betta fish should be fed two to four pellets twice a day. In nature, bettas subsist almost exclusively on insects and insect larvae. They are built with an upturned mouth that is well suited to snatching any hapless insect that might fall into the water. Internally their digestive system is geared for meat, having a much shorter alimentary track than vegetarian fish. For this reason, live foods are the ideal diet for the betta, however, they will adapt to eating flake foods and frozen or freeze-dried foods, such as:
    
    <ul>Brine shrimp</ul>
    <ul>Daphnia</ul>
    <ul>Plankton</ul>
    <ul>Tubifex</ul>
    <ul>Glassworms</ul>
    <ul>Beef heart</ul>
