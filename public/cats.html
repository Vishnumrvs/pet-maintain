    </p>
    <p>Developed to resemble big cats, the highlander is a medium to large, muscular, and athletic cat with a naturally short tail. The highlander comes in both shorthaired and longhaired versions, and they may come in any color in solid, tortie, tabby, or silver/smoke patterns.</p>
    <h3>Highlander Cat Care </h3>
    <p>
        Highlanders come with both short and long coats, so grooming varies depending on coat length. Brush both coat types several times a week with a soft slicker brush to remove loose hair and cut down on shedding on your furniture and clothing. For the longhaired highlander, pay careful attention to the shaggy belly hair, which is longer than the rest of the coat. Brush or comb this belly fur thoroughly to prevent matting. Bathe your highlander with a moisturizing shampoo every few months to keep the coat clean, soft, and shiny.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Because the highlander cat is naturally active and athletically built, he’s less inclined to become overweight. But any cat has the potential to overindulge if nutrition is not managed properly. A lean cat is a healthier cat, and staying slim can help prevent the development of obesity-related health issues like diabetes and arthritis. Don’t keep the food bowl filled all day. Instead, feed adult highlanders two meals a day. Young kittens should eat three to four times a day.</p>

    <p>Burmese cats are medium-sized felines with strong, muscular bodies, rounded heads, and expressive gold eyes. These affectionate and intelligent kitties may descend from an ancient breed in Myanmar (formerly Burma), but they were officially bred in the United States in the 1930s.</p>
    <h3>Burmese Care</h3>
    <p>Burmese cats' coats are short and fine with a glossy, silky shine. They require minimal grooming and do not shed much. Grooming your cat with a rubber brush once a week should be enough to rid the coat of dead hairs and keep it looking lustrous</p>
    <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
    <p>
        To keep up with their active lifestyle, these cats need plenty of protein and nutrients. It is always best to discuss diet options with your vet to ensure all of your cat's needs are being met. High-quality dry food helps maintain good oral health and can be supplemented with wet food for added hydration.</p>

        <p>The Korat, also known as the Si-Sawat, is a stunning cat breed that originated in Thailand over 900 years ago. Known by its distinctive silver-tipped blue-gray coat and heart-shaped face, this cat has won countless admirers for its looks as well as its unique personality. It's considered a symbol of good luck in its native Thailand.
        The Korat (pronounced as koh-raht, not core-rat) is a small-to-medium feline with a sturdy, strong build and lively, alert expression.</p>
        <h3>Korat Cat Care</h3>
        <p>
            The Korat cat is extremely intelligent, playful, and affectionate. These smart felines can form a close bond with their people and love to be an involved part of your daily activities. Because of this, they do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. They are social cats and love to be with their special person. These cats should have a companion to keep them company, whether that is you or another animal. Being left alone can lead to separation anxiety and an unhappy Korat.</p>
<h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
<p>
    Providing your Korat with high-quality food will help ensure a long and healthy life. Every cat will have its own likes, dislikes, and dietary needs, but a good cat food formulated specifically for the dietary needs of felines should provide all the nutrients your pet needs to thrive. Consult your veterinarian for more information on the diet that best suits your feline.</p>
