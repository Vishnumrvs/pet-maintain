                    </p>
                    <p>Developed to resemble big cats, the highlander is a medium to large, muscular, and athletic cat
                        with a naturally short tail. The highlander comes in both shorthaired and longhaired versions,
                        and they may come in any color in solid, tortie, tabby, or silver/smoke patterns.</p>
                    <h3>Highlander Cat Care </h3>
                    <p>
                        Highlanders come with both short and long coats, so grooming varies depending on coat length.
                        Brush both coat types several times a week with a soft slicker brush to remove loose hair and
                        cut down on shedding on your furniture and clothing. For the longhaired highlander, pay careful
                        attention to the shaggy belly hair, which is longer than the rest of the coat. Brush or comb
                        this belly fur thoroughly to prevent matting. Bathe your highlander with a moisturizing shampoo
                        every few months to keep the coat clean, soft, and shiny.</p>
                    <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because the highlander cat is naturally active and athletically built, he’s less inclined to
                        become overweight. But any cat has the potential to overindulge if nutrition is not managed
                        properly. A lean cat is a healthier cat, and staying slim can help prevent the development of
                        obesity-related health issues like diabetes and arthritis. Don’t keep the food bowl filled all
                        day. Instead, feed adult highlanders two meals a day. Young kittens should eat three to four
                        times a day.</p>

            <h2>Burmese</h2>
            <p>Burmese cats are medium-sized felines with strong, muscular bodies, rounded heads, and expressive gold
                eyes. These affectionate and intelligent kitties may descend from an ancient breed in Myanmar (formerly
                Burma), but they were officially bred in the United States in the 1930s.</p>

            <h3>Burmese Care</h3>
            <p>Burmese cats' coats are short and fine with a glossy, silky shine. They require minimal grooming and do
                not shed much. Grooming your cat with a rubber brush once a week should be enough to rid the coat of
                dead hairs and keep it looking lustrous</p>
            <h3>Diet and Nutrition
                <p>
                    To keep up with their active lifestyle, these cats need plenty of protein and nutrients. It is
                    always best to discuss diet options with your vet to ensure all of your cat's needs are being met.
                    High-quality dry food helps maintain good oral health and can be supplemented with wet food for
                    added hydration.</p>
